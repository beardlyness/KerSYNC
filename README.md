Making it easier to setup rsync, and setup a duplicate mirror of the kernel.org repository.

# Options
Would you like to setup a Web server to serve the mirror content? (Y/N)
- We highly recommend setting up a Web server to serve the mirror content, and we offer multiple web server install options (I.E. Apache, NGINX, Hiawatha.)

# Usage
Log into your server via ssh and download the raw kersync.sh script and then execute it.<br>
- `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/beardlyness/KerSYNC/master/kersync.sh`<br>
